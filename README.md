## About

### Background

This project was started in January 2020 at BoilerMake VII, Purdue University's largest hackathon. My team (of two) wanted to build a community based on competitive basketball pickup games. Many people have a competitive spirit, so we were curious what might happen if we introduced more competitiveness to an already competitive game. 

### Features

Players are assigned a ranking based on game performance (margin of victory and winning team). The top 5 players are displayed on a leaderboard, and players will move around the leaderboard if their ranking changes.

### Technologies Used

- Python + [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)
- [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

### Challenges Faced

- First time using Flask and Airtable

### Planned Features

- Standalone website
- Display more than 5 players on the leaderboard
- Create user profiles to track individual statistics
